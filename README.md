# libft
The libft project builds on the concepts you learned during Day-06 of the bootcamp
ie code a library of useful functions that you will be allowed to reuse in most of your C
projects this year. This will save you a lot of precious time. The following assignments
will have you write lines of code you already wrote during the bootcamp. See the libft
project as a Bootcamp reminder and use it wisely to assess your level and progress.
